  # https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/forms/: Once the form action gets called for the first time, the form gets activated and will prompt the user for the next required slot value. It does this by looking for a response called utter_ask_<form_name>_<slot_name> or utter_ask_<slot_name> if the former isn't found. Make sure to define these responses in your domain file for each required slot.
